# neural_network_charity_analysis

## Overview

For this challenge I created a model that predicts if funding is provided by Alphabet soup to an organization will that organization be successful. To do this I used a CSV that contained over 34,000 previous organizations that were funded and completed created the model around that CSV to predict if an organization will use the money effectively.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
 - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
 * The target for the model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL"
 - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
 * all columns are features expect for the target column and the two that I dropped/
 - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
 * EIN and NAME were droped as they are neither targets nor features.
